## What is the openVulnAPI?

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) openVuln API is a RESTful API that allows customers to obtain Cisco Security Vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. APIs are important for customers because they allow their technical staff and programmers to build tools that help them do their job more effectively (in this case, to keep up with security vulnerability information). More information about the API can be found at: <https://developer.cisco.com/psirt>
